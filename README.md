# Exploring-CMDLets


> THIS IS BY A BEGINNER/NOOB/ROOKIE so please forgive my jargons and the way I explain some stuff.
These are lab works from my classes that I had asnwered and wish to share here as well.
I would like to thank my professors for being cool and chill, hopefully sharing my learnings are okay. 

I am currently taking courses for my AAS in Information Systems Technology, majoring in Cybersecurity. I am creating these repositories to get used to documenting my learnings and also people who are not as tech savvy, like me, to know about these things.

We can do this!
