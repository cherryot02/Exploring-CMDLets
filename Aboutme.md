# Some Background About Me

Hi, everyone!! My name is Cherry and I also go by the name "Cherryot (Cherry on top)". The name _Cherryot_ was born during my time as a passionate artist wanting to find a psuedo name. But I still use it to this very day because, well, I am still an artist. I am half-Filipino and half-Chinese. Now, I reside in the United States. Yay my identity crisis worsens :) pero teka lang ang hirap mag-english kainis.

But, my career path has changed. From being an art student (digital graphic design) to now a cybersecurity student. I had these change of heart after living in the US for about half a year. So I had to look for another program of study and I came across "cybersecurity." All my life, I have always avoided the STEM studies because I thought to myself, I am not smart enough of this. It sort of stems from growing up and studying at a filipino-chinese private school that had many of those "smart" people who were actively competing in robotics, math, english, etc. classes. Basically, I am just an average student. I excelled sometimes, but also failed quite a number of times.

I did do a little bit of research and learned about the different teams: Blue Team and
Red Team. I know there are more since that's where I am right now in one my courses but I am saying when I started, those two were the ones I have heard. Anyway, I decided to stick with the blue team. Red teaming is fun, sure, but if there are already a lot of offensive teams wearing different hats, who are going to defend those? In any case, I wanted to learn something new, helpful, and fun. Because I find it hard to study when I am not interested in the subject.

I would like to thank Last Mile Education and Microsoft for giving out cybersecurity scholarship because now I am introduced to the world of cybersecurity! 
I am also thanking my professors for being so chill and cool because it makes these topics a little bit more interesting and fun. They are also helpful and will reccomend jobs that they see fit.
Thank you!!! I am trying my best to keep myself interested and skilled. Although, I am not skilled and really not smart enough for this ahahaha.

As of making these blogs and documentations, I am at my second year in college but technically my first year AGAIN because I started over. I am studying for an Associate's degree in Information systems technology, specializing in Cybersecurity. Hopefully I am done by summer of 2025. It's hard to keep up as a not-so-smart student and also having a job(I used to be fulltime but decided to go parttime for my studies.) It drains me so I really hope I get a better job that would help my career.
